<p>One of the major decisions involved in starting, or growing, a business is how to legally structure the business entity. If one does nothing, then a sole proprietorship is created. This has great flexibility but unlimited personal liability. If one starts a business with another, but takes no legal steps, a general partnership has been created. Again, this offers unlimited personal liability. In contrast, creating a business entity like an LLC takes little effort and offers the owner protection against lawsuits.</p>

<p>Once a business has been created, often other people must accomplish tasks for the business. This invokes an area of law called "agency", which governs actions one does on behalf of another, subject to their control. We will learn, for instance, when a business may find itself responsible for the torts of its employees.</p>

<p>This chapter offers a condensed version of Chapters 38 through 42, inclusive. If you wish to explore an area in greater detail, many of these issues are treated much more extensively in those chapters.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sole Proprietorships</h2>

<p>If an individual starts a business by themselves without taking any legal precautions, they have created a "sole proprietorship". This is a business in which the owner <em>is</em> the business. This offers great flexibility: if the owner wishes to work, they may do so. If they wish not to work, nobody will compel them. The owner can come and go as they please, set prices as they desire, hire the employees they want, and fire employees they don't like, all without consulting other owners. </p>

<p>These are definitely advantages! It lets businesses be nimble, and one can start such a business without legal formalities. In fact, many small businesses in the United States begin as sole proprietorships. If you've began a solo business enterprise without taking other legal steps, then you created a sole proprietorship without realizing it.</p>

<p>At the same time, operating as a sole proprietor has major disadvantages. First, it can be hard to raise capital for the business, because you cannot offer ownership rights in the form of stock or partnership interests. Second, this type of business form has unlimited personal liability. Because the owner <em>is</em> the business, the owner faces unlimited personal liability for the business. If someone slips and falls on the premises because the owner was negligent in cleaning up a spill, and then sues and wins, the owner may lose their home or retirement account, or be forced into bankruptcy. </p>

<p>For these reasons, particularly the second, careful entrepreneurs give thought to liability as they begin a business. Some feel comfortable by purchasing liability insurance, while many others take the steps to create a business entity that offers a liability shield, such as a Limited Liability Company or LLC. Forming an LLC is relatively painless and can protect the personal assets of the owner.</p>

At the same time, the absence of a liability shield means that the proprietor will be personally responsible for the liability of the business.</p>

<h2>Agency: When Others Act For You</h2>

<p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s01_s01_p01">Unless one operates a business completely alone, it is likely they will need the help of others. An "agent" is a person who acts in the name of and on behalf of another, having been given and assumed some degree of authority to do so. Most organized human activity—and virtually all commercial activity—is carried on through agency. No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without such a concept. We might say “General Motors is building cars in China,” for example, but we can’t shake hands with General Motors. “The General,” as people say, exists and works through agents. Likewise, partnerships and other business organizations rely extensively on agents to conduct their business. Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to say that agency is the cornerstone of enterprise organization. In a partnership each partner is a general agent, while under corporation law the officers and all employees are agents of the corporation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s01_s01_p02">The existence of agents does not, however, require a whole new law of torts or contracts. A tort is no less harmful when committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when negotiated by an agent. What does need to be taken into account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on behalf of his principal and toward a third party.</p>




<h2>Types of Agency Relationships</h2>

<p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s02_s01_p01">The general agent<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Someone authorized to transact every kind of business for the principal.</span></span> possesses the authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name and on behalf of the principal. The general agent may be the manager of a business or may have a more limited but nevertheless ongoing role—for example, as a purchasing agent or as a life insurance agent authorized to sign up customers for the home office. In either case, the general agent has authority to alter the principal’s legal relationships with third parties. One who is designated a general agent has the authority to act in any way required by the principal’s business. To restrict the general agent’s authority, the principal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the agent’s acts in excess of his authority.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s02_s01_p02">Normally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual may appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the person who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his stead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in <a class="xref" href="#mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s02_s01_f01">Figure 57.1 "General Power of Attorney"</a>. Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell real estate or securities in the absence of the owner. But a person facing a lengthy operation and recuperation in a hospital might give a general power of attorney to a trusted family member or friend.</p>

              <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s02_s02_p01">The special agent<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">An agent hired by contract to carry out specifically stated activities.</span></span> is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a specifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired to find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer for his property. Alberta’s commission depends on the selling price, which, Sam states in a letter to her, “in any event may be no less than $150,000.” If Alberta locates a buyer, Bob, who agrees to purchase the property for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale will not bind Sam. As a special agent, Alberta had authority only to find a buyer; she had no authority to sign the contract.</p>
      
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s02_s03_p01">An agent whose reimbursement depends on his continuing to have the authority to act as an agent is said to have an agency coupled with an interest<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">An agency in which the agent has an interest in the property regarding which he or she is acting on the principal’s behalf.</span></span> if he has a property interest in the business. A literary or author’s agent, for example, customarily agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a percentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work. The literary agent also acts as a collection agent to ensure that his commission will be paid. By agreeing with the principal that the agency is coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being terminated to his detriment.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creation of the Agency Relationship</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s03_p01">The agency relationship can be created in two ways: by agreement (expressly) or by operation of law (constructively or impliedly).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s03_s01_p01">Most agencies are created by contract. Thus the general rules of contract law covered in the prior chapter govern the law of agency. But agencies can also be created without contract, by agreement. Therefore, three contract principles are especially important: the first is the requirement for consideration, the second for a writing, and the third concerns contractual capacity.</p>
            <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s03_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Consideration</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s03_s01_s01_p01">Agencies created by consent—agreement—are not necessarily contractual. It is not uncommon for one person to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some errands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a gratuitous agency<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">An agency where the agent receives no compensation.</span></span> gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s03_s01_s02_p01">Most oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In practice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an agency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within one year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to pay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; and (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s03_s01_s02_p02">Even when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third parties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires contracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.”</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s03_s01_s03_p01">A contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and agent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—there can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. Generally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the contract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent. There are, however, a few situations in which the capacity of the agent is important. Thus a mentally incompetent agent cannot bind a principal.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s03_s02_s01_p01">In areas of social need, courts have declared an agency to exist in the absence of an agreement. The agency relationship then is said to have been implied “by operation of law.” Children in most states may purchase necessary items—food or medical services—on the parent’s account. Long-standing social policy deems it desirable for the head of a family to support his dependents, and the courts will put the expense on the family head in order to provide for the dependents’ welfare. The courts achieve this result by supposing the dependent to be the family head’s agent, thus allowing creditors to sue the family head for the debt.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s01_s03_s02_s01_p02">Implied agencies also arise where one person behaves as an agent would and the “principal,” knowing that the “agent” is behaving so, acquiesces, allowing the person to hold himself out as an agent.

It <em class="emphasis">appeared</em> that Arthur was an authorized agent. Thus, principals such as business owners need to take care they do not create the impression to third parties that authority exists for the agents to act, otherwise they may find they have inadvertantly created agency power and will be bound by the actions of the agent, whether or not they gave the agent express authority to act.<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">If a rogue agent binds the principal under apparent authority, although the principal will be bound by the agent's actions, the agent will be liable to the principal for violating the agency relationships.</span></p>
                
                


<h2>Duties of Principals and Agents</h2>

    <h3>Agent's Duties to the Principal</h3>

<p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_p01">The agent owes the principal duties in two categories: the fiduciary duty and a set of general duties imposed by agency law. But these general duties are not unique to agency law; they are duties owed by any employee to the employer.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Fiduciary Duty</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_s01_p01">In a nonagency contractual situation, the parties’ responsibilities terminate at the border of the contract. There is no relationship beyond the agreement. This literalist approach is justified by the more general principle that we each should be free to act unless we commit ourselves to a particular course.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_s01_p02">But the agency relationship is more than a contractual one, and the agent’s responsibilities go beyond the border of the contract. Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It imposes a fiduciary duty<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The duty of an agent to act always in the best interest of the principal, to avoid self-dealing.</span></span>. The law infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and reverses the general principle that the parties are free to act in the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the principal, the agent stands in a position of special trust. His responsibility is to subordinate his self-interest to that of his principal. The fiduciary responsibility is imposed by law. The absence of any clause in the contract detailing the agent’s fiduciary duty does not relieve him of it. The duty contains several aspects.</p>
           
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_s01_s01_p01">A fiduciary may not lawfully profit from a conflict between his personal interest in a transaction and his principal’s interest in that same transaction. A broker hired as a purchasing agent, for instance, may not sell to his principal through a company in which he or his family has a financial interest. The penalty for breach of fiduciary duty is loss of compensation and profit and possible damages for breach of trust.</p>
             
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_s01_s02_p01">To further his objectives, a principal will usually need to reveal a number of secrets to his agent—how much he is willing to sell or pay for property, marketing strategies, and the like. Such information could easily be turned to the disadvantage of the principal if the agent were to compete with the principal or were to sell the information to those who do. The law therefore prohibits an agent from using for his own purposes or in ways that would injure the interests of the principal, information confidentially given or acquired. This prohibition extends to information gleaned from the principal though unrelated to the agent’s assignment: “[A]n agent who is told by the principal of his plans, or who secretly examines books or memoranda of the employer, is not privileged to use such information at his principal’s expense.” Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 395. Nor may the agent use confidential information after resigning his agency. Though he is free, in the absence of contract, to compete with his former principal, he may not use information learned in the course of his agency, such as trade secrets and customer lists.</p>
      
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_s02_p01">In addition to fiduciary responsibility (and whatever special duties may be contained in the specific contract) the law of agency imposes other duties on an agent. These duties are not necessarily unique to agents: a nonfiduciary employee could also be bound to these duties on the right facts.</p>
            <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_s02_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Duty of Skill and Care</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_s02_s01_p01">An agent is usually taken on because he has special knowledge or skills that the principal wishes to tap. The agent is under a legal duty to perform his work with the care and skill that is “standard in the locality for the kind of work which he is employed to perform” and to exercise any special skills, if these are greater or more refined than those prevalent among those normally employed in the community. In short, the agent may not lawfully do a sloppy job.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn38_005">Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 379.</span></p>
       
                     <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s01_s02_s02_p01">In the absence of an agreement, a principal may not ordinarily dictate how an agent must live his private life. An overly fastidious florist may not instruct her truck driver to steer clear of the local bar on his way home from delivering flowers at the end of the day. But there are some jobs on which the personal habits of the agent may have an effect. The agent is not at liberty to act with impropriety or notoriety, so as to bring disrepute on the business in which the principal is engaged.

A principal’s wishes may have been stated ambiguously or may be broad enough to confer discretion on the agent. As long as the agent acts reasonably under the circumstances, he will not be liable for damages later if the principal ultimately repudiates what the agent has done: “Only conduct which is contrary to the principal’s manifestations to him, interpreted in light of what he has reason to know at the time when he acts,…subjects the agent to liability to the principal.” Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 383.</p>

What is reasonable depends on the customs of the industry or trade, prior dealings between agent and principal, and the nature of the agreement creating the agency. A principal may prescribe uniforms for various classes of employees, for instance, and a manufacturing company may tell its sales force what sales pitch to use on customers. On the other hand, certain tasks entrusted to agents are not subject to the principal’s control; for example, a lawyer may refuse to permit a client to dictate courtroom tactics.</p>

    <h3>Principal's Duties to the Agent</h3>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s02_s01_p01">The fiduciary relationship of agent to principal does not run in reverse—that is, the principal is not the agent’s fiduciary. Nevertheless, the principal has a number of contractually related obligations toward his agent.</p>
         
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch38_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">These duties are analogues of many of the agent’s duties that we have just examined. In brief, a principal has a duty “to refrain from unreasonably interfering with [an agent’s] work.” Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 434. The principal is allowed, however, to compete with the agent unless the agreement specifically prohibits it. The principal has a duty to inform his agent of risks of physical harm or pecuniary loss that inhere in the agent’s performance of assigned tasks. Failure to warn an agent that travel in a particular neighborhood required by the job may be dangerous (a fact unknown to the agent but known to the principal) could under common law subject the principal to a suit for damages if the agent is injured while in the neighborhood performing her job. A principal is obliged to render accounts of monies due to agents; a principal’s obligation to do so depends on a variety of factors, including the degree of independence of the agent, the method of compensation, and the customs of the particular business. An agent’s reputation is no less valuable than a principal’s, and so an agent is under no obligation to continue working for one who sullies it.</p>
       




<h2>Liability of Principals and Agents</h2>




<p>The principal is liable on an agent’s contract only if the agent was authorized by the principal to make the contract. Such authority is express, implied, or apparent. <em class="emphasis">Express</em> means made in words, orally or in writing; <em class="emphasis">implied</em> means the agent has authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying out the transaction for which she has express authority. <em class="emphasis">Apparent authority</em> arises where the principal gives the third party reason to believe that the agent had authority. The reasonableness of the third party’s belief is based on all the circumstances—all the facts. Even if the agent has no authority, the principal may, after the fact, ratify the contract made by the agent.</p>

<p>The principal will be liable for the employee’s torts in two circumstances: first, if the principal was directly responsible, as in hiring a person the principal knew or should have known was incompetent or dangerous; second, if the employee committed the tort in the scope of business for the principal. This is the master-servant doctrine or respondeat superior. It imposes vicarious liability on the employer: the master (employer) will be liable if the employee was in the zone of activity creating a risk for the employer (“zone of risk” test), that is—generally—if the employee was where he was supposed to be, when he was supposed to be there, and the incident arose out of the employee’s interest (however perverted) in promoting the employer’s business.</p>

<p>Special cases of vicarious liability arise in several circumstances. For example, the owner of an automobile may be liable for torts committed by one who borrows it, or if it is—even if indirectly—used for family purposes. Parents are, by statute in many states, liable for their children’s torts. Similarly by statute, the sellers and employers of sellers of alcohol or adulterated or short-weight foodstuffs may be liable. The employer of one who commits a crime is not usually liable unless the employer put the employee up to the crime or knew that a crime was being committed. But some prophylactic statutes impose liability on the employer for the employee’s crime—even if the employee had no intention to commit it—as a means to force the employer to prevent such actions.</p>


<p>A person is always liable for her own torts, so an agent who commits a tort is liable; if the tort was in the scope of employment the principal is liable too. Unless the principal put the agent up to committing the tort, the agent will have to reimburse the principal. An agent is not generally liable for contracts made; the principal is liable. But the agent will be liable if he is undisclosed or partially disclosed, if the agent lacks authority or exceeds it, or, of course, if the agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity.</p>

<p>Agencies terminate expressly or impliedly or by operation of law. An agency terminates expressly by the terms of the agreement or mutual consent, or by the principal’s revocation or the agent’s renunciation. An agency terminates impliedly by any number of circumstances in which it is reasonable to assume one or both of the parties would not want the relationship to continue. An agency will terminate by operation of law when one or the other party dies or becomes incompetent, or if the object of the agency becomes illegal. However, an agent may have apparent lingering authority, so the principal, upon termination of the agency, should notify those who might deal with the agent that the relationship is severed.</p>

        <h2>Fraud</h2>

<p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p02">Misrepresentation<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A false or misleading statement or impression given that induces a party to contract.</span></span> is a statement of fact that is not consistent with the truth. If misrepresentation is intentional, it is fraudulent misrepresentation; if it is not intentional, it is nonfraudulent misrepresentation, which can be either negligent or innocent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p03">In further taxonomy, courts distinguish between fraud in the execution and fraud in the inducement. Fraud in the execution<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Causing a person to sign a legal document while that person believes he or she is signing some other type of document.</span></span> is defined by the Restatement as follows: “If a misrepresentation as to the character or essential terms of a proposed contract induces conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by one who neither knows nor has reasonable opportunity to know of the character or essential terms of the proposed contract, his conduct is not effective as a manifestation of assent.”<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 163.</span> For example, Alphonse and Gaston decide to sign a written contract incorporating terms to which they have agreed. It is properly drawn up, and Gaston reads it and approves it. Before he can sign it, however, Alphonse shrewdly substitutes a different version to which Gaston has not agreed. Gaston signs the substitute version. There is no contract. There has been fraud in the execution.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p04">Fraud in the inducement<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Deceit or trick to cause someone to contract to his or her disadvantage.</span></span> is more common.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_p01">Again, generally, any statement not in accord with the facts (a fact is something amenable to testing as true) is a misrepresentation. Falsity does not depend on intent. A typist’s unnoticed error in a letter (inadvertently omitting the word “not,” for example, or transposing numbers) can amount to a misrepresentation on which the recipient may rely (it is not fraudulent misrepresentation). A half-truth can amount to a misrepresentation, as, for example, when the seller of a hotel says that the income is from both permanent and transient guests but fails to disclose that the bulk of the income is from single-night stopovers by seamen using the hotel as a brothel. <label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em class="emphasis">Ikeda v.

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">Another type of misrepresentation is concealment. It is an act that is equivalent to a statement that the facts are to the contrary and that serves to prevent the other party from learning the true statement of affairs; it is hiding the truth. A common example is painting over defects in a building—by concealing the defects, the owner is misrepresenting the condition of the property. The act of concealment need not be direct; it may consist of sidetracking the other party from gaining necessary knowledge by, for example, convincing a third person who has knowledge of the defect not to speak. Concealment is always a misrepresentation.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s02_p01">A more passive type of concealment is nondisclosure. Although generally the law imposes no obligation on anyone to speak out, nondisclosure of a fact can operate as a misrepresentation under certain circumstances. This occurs, for example, whenever the other party has erroneous information, or, as <em class="emphasis">Reed v. King</em> (<a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch10_s05#mayer_1.0-ch10_s05_s02">Section 10.5.2 "Misrepresentation by Concealment"</a>) shows, where the nondisclosure amounts to a failure to act in good faith, or where the party who conceals knows or should know that the other side cannot, with reasonable diligence, discover the truth.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s02_p02">In a remarkable 1991 case out of New York, a New York City stockbroker bought an old house upstate (basically anyplace north of New York City) in the village of Nyack, north of New York City, and then wanted out of the deal when he discovered—the defendant seller had not told him—that it was “haunted.” The court summarized the facts: “Plaintiff, to his horror, discovered that the house he had recently contracted to purchase was widely reputed to be possessed by poltergeists [ghosts], reportedly seen by defendant seller and members of her family on numerous occasions over the last nine years. Plaintiff promptly commenced this action seeking rescission of the contract of sale. Supreme Court reluctantly dismissed the complaint, holding that plaintiff has no remedy at law in this jurisdiction.”</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s02_p03">The high court of New York ruled he could rescind the contract because the house was “haunted as a matter of law”: the defendant had promoted it as such on village tours and in <em class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest</em>. She had concealed it, and no reasonable buyer’s inspection would have revealed the “fact.” The dissent basically hooted, saying, “The existence of a poltergeist is no more binding upon the defendants than it is upon this court.” <label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em class="emphasis">Stambovsky v.

For example, in idle chatter one day, Alphonse tells Gaston that he owns thirty acres of land. In fact, Alphonse owns only twenty-seven, but he decided to exaggerate a little. He meant no harm by it, since the conversation had no import. A year later, Gaston offers to buy the “thirty acres” from Alphonse, who does not correct the impression that Gaston has. The failure to speak is a nondisclosure—presumably intentional, in this situation—that would allow Gaston to rescind a contract induced by his belief that he was purchasing thirty acres.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s04_p01">An opinion, of course, is not a fact; neither is sales puffery. For example, the statements “In my opinion this apple is very tasty” and “These apples are the best in the county” are not facts; they are not expected to be taken as true. Reliance on opinion is hazardous and generally not considered justifiable.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s04_p02">If Jack asks what condition the car is in that he wishes to buy, Mr. Olson’s response of “Great!” is not ordinarily a misrepresentation.

Merely because someone is less astute than the one with whom she is bargaining does not give rise to a claim of justifiable reliance on an unwarranted opinion. But if the person is inexperienced and susceptible or gullible to blandishments, the contract can be voided, as illustrated in <em class="emphasis">Vokes v.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s02_p01">The second element necessary to prove fraud is that the misrepresentation was intentionally made. A misrepresentation is intentionally made “if the maker intends his assertion to induce a party to manifest his assent and the maker (a) knows or believes that the assertion is not in accord with the facts, or (b) does not have the confidence that he states or implies in the truth of the assertion, or (c) knows that he does not have the basis that he states or implies for the assertion.”<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 162(1).</span> </p>

        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reliance</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s03_p01">The final element necessary to prove fraud is reliance by the victim. He or she must show that the misrepresentation induced assent—that is, he or she relied on it. The reliance need not be solely on the false assertion; the defendant cannot win the case by demonstrating that the plaintiff would have assented to the contract even without the misrepresentation. It is sufficient to avoid the contract if the plaintiff weighed the assertion as one of the important factors leading him to make the contract, and he believed it to be true. The person who asserts reliance to avoid a contract must have acted in good faith and reasonably in relying on the false assertion. Thus if the victim failed to read documents given him that truly stated the facts, he cannot later complain that he relied on a contrary statement, as, for example, when the purchaser of a car dealership was told the inventory consisted of new cars, but the supporting papers, receipt of which he acknowledged, clearly stated how many miles each car had been driven. If Mr. Olson tells Jack that the car Jack is interested in is “a recognized classic,” and if Jack doesn’t care a whit about that but buys the car because he likes its tail fins, he will have no case against Mr. Olson when he finds out the car is not a classic: it didn’t matter to him, and he didn’t rely on it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s03_p02">Ordinarily, the person relying on a statement need not verify it independently. However, if verification is relatively easy, or if the statement is one that concerns matters peculiarly within the person’s purview, he or she may not be held to have justifiably relied on the other party’s false assertion. Moreover, usually the rule of reliance applies to statements about past events or existing facts, not about the occurrence of events in the future.</p>

        <h2>Mistake</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s03_p01">In discussing fraud, we have considered the ways in which trickery by the other party makes a contract void or voidable. We now examine the ways in which the parties might “trick” themselves by making assumptions that lead them mistakenly to believe that they have agreed to something they have not. A mistake is “a belief about a fact that is not in accord with the truth.”

It is defined by the Restatement (Second) of Contracts in Section 174: “If conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by a party who does not intend to engage in that conduct is physically compelled by duress, the conduct is not effective as a manifestation of assent.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p02">Comment (a) to Section 174 provides in part, “This Section involves an application of that principle to those <em class="emphasis">relatively rare situations in which actual physical force</em> has been used to compel a party to appear to assent to a contract.…The essence of this type of duress is that a party is compelled by physical force to do an act that he has no intention of doing.

Here the perpetrator threatens the victim, who feels there is no reasonable alternative but to assent to the contract. It renders the contract voidable. This rule contains a number of elements.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p02">First, the threat must be improper. Second, there must be no reasonable alternative. If, for example, a supplier threatens to hold up shipment of necessary goods unless the buyer agrees to pay more than the contract price, this would not be duress if the buyer could purchase identical supplies from someone else. Third, the test for inducement is subjective. It does not matter that the person threatened is unusually timid or that a reasonable person would not have felt threatened. The question is whether the threat in fact induced assent by the victim. Such facts as the victim’s belief that the threatener had the ability to carry out the threat and the length of time between the threat and assent are relevant in determining whether the threat did prompt the assent.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p03">There are many types of improper threats that might induce a party to enter into a contract: threats to commit a crime or a tort (e.g., bodily harm or taking of property), to instigate criminal prosecution, to instigate civil proceedings when a threat is made in bad faith, to breach a “duty of good faith and fair dealing under a contract with the recipient,” or to disclose embarrassing details about a person’s private life.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p04">Jack buys a car from a local used-car salesman, Mr. Olson, and the next day realizes he bought a lemon. He threatens to break windows in Olson’s showroom if Olson does not buy the car back for $2,150, the purchase price. Mr. Olson agrees. The agreement is voidable, even though the underlying deal is fair, if Olson feels he has no reasonable alternative and is frightened into agreeing. Suppose Jack knows that Olson has been tampering with his cars’ odometers, a federal offense, and threatens to have Olson prosecuted if he will not repurchase the car. Even though Olson may be guilty, this threat makes the repurchase contract voidable, because it is a misuse for personal ends of a power (to go to the police) given each of us for other purposes. If these threats failed, suppose Jack then tells Olson, “I’m going to haul you into court and sue your pants off.” If Jack means he will sue for his purchase price, this is not an improper threat, because everyone has the right to use the courts to gain what they think is rightfully theirs. But if Jack meant that he would fabricate damages done him by a (falsely) claimed odometer manipulation, that would be an improper threat. Although Olson could defend against the suit, his reputation would suffer in the meantime from his being accused of odometer tampering.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p05">A threat to breach a contract that induces the victim to sign a new contract could be improper. Suppose that as part of the original purchase price, Olson agrees to make all necessary repairs and replace all failed parts for the first ninety days. At the end of one month, the transmission dies, and Jack demands a replacement. Olson refuses to repair the car unless Jack signs a contract agreeing to buy his next car from Olson. Whether this threat is improper depends on whether Jack has a reasonable alternative; if a replacement transmission is readily available and Jack has the funds to pay for it, he might have an alternative in suing Olson in small claims court for the cost. But if Jack needs the car immediately and he is impecunious, then the threat would be improper and the contract voidable. A threat to breach a contract is not necessarily improper, however. It depends on whether the new contract is fair and equitable because of unanticipated circumstances. If, for example, Olson discovers that he must purchase a replacement transmission at three times the anticipated cost, his threat to hold up work unless Jack agrees to pay for it might be reasonable.</p>

It is a milder form of duress than physical harm or threats. The unfairness does not lie in any misrepresentation; rather, it occurs when the victim is under the domination of the persuader or is one who, in view of the relationship between them, is warranted in believing that the persuader will act in a manner detrimental to the victim’s welfare if the victim fails to assent. It is the improper use of trust or power to deprive a person of free will and substitute instead another’s objective. Usually the fact pattern involves the victim being isolated from receiving advice except from the persuader. Falling within this rule are situations where, for example, a child takes advantage of an infirm parent, a doctor takes advantage of an ill patient, or a lawyer takes advantage of an unknowledgeable client. If there has been undue influence, the contract is voidable by the party who has been unfairly persuaded. Whether the relationship is one of domination and the persuasion is unfair is a factual question. The answer hinges on a host of variables, including “the unfairness of the resulting bargain, the unavailability of independent advice, and the susceptibility of the person persuaded.” <label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 177(b).</span> See <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch10_s05#mayer_1.0-ch10_s05_s01">Section 10.5.1 "Undue Influence"</a>, <em class="emphasis">Hodge v.

        <h2>Illegal contracts</h2>

                <h3>Contracts that violate a statute</h3>

<p>
Any bargain that violates the criminal law—including statutes that govern extortion, robbery, embezzlement, forgery, some gambling, licensing, and consumer credit transactions—is illegal. Thus determining whether contracts are lawful may seem to be an easy enough task. Clearly, whenever the statute itself explicitly forbids the making of the contract or the performance agreed upon, the bargain (such as a contract to sell drugs) is unlawful. But when the statute does not expressly prohibit the making of the contract, courts examine a number of factors.</p>


        <h3>Unconscionable contracts</h3>


 <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p01">Courts may refuse to enforce unconscionable contracts<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A contract so unfair as to be unenforceable.</span></span>, those that are very one-sided, unfair, the product of unequal bargaining power, or oppressive; a court may find the contract divisible and enforce only the parts that are not unconscionable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p02">The common-law rule is reflected in Section 208 of the Restatement: “If a contract or term thereof is unconscionable at the time the contract is made a court may refuse to enforce the contract, or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable term, or may so limit the application of any unconscionable term as to avoid any unconscionable result.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p03">And the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) (again, of course, a statute, not common law) provides a similar rule in Section 2-302(1): “If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p04"><em class="emphasis">Unconscionable</em> is not defined in the Restatement or the UCC, but cases have given gloss to the meaning, as in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch12_s05#mayer_1.0-ch12_s05_s03">Section 12.5.3 "Unconscionability"</a>, <em class="emphasis">Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.</em>, a well-known early interpretation of the section by the DC Court of Appeals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p05">Unconscionability may arise procedurally or substantively. A term is procedurally unconscionable if it is imposed upon the “weaker” party because of fine or inconspicuous print, unexpected placement in the contract, lack of opportunity to read the term, lack of education or sophistication that precludes understanding, or lack of equality of bargaining power. Substantive unconscionability arises where the affected terms are oppressive and harsh, where the term deprives a party of any real remedy for breach. Most often—but not always—courts find unconscionable contracts in the context of consumer transactions rather than commercial transactions. In the latter case, the assumption is that the parties tend to be sophisticated businesspeople able to look out for their own contract interests.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Specific contractual pitfalls</h3>

<p>Courts have long held that public policy disfavors attempts to contract out of tort liability. Exculpatory clauses that exempt one party from tort liability to the other for harm caused intentionally or recklessly are unenforceable without exception. A contract provision that exempts a party from tort liability for negligence is unenforceable under two general circumstances: (1) when it “exempts an employer from liability to an employee for injury in the course of his employment” or (2) when it exempts one charged with a duty of public service and who is receiving compensation from liability to one to whom the duty is owed.<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 195.</span>   Contract terms with offensive exculpatory clauses may be considered somewhat akin to unconscionability.
</p>
<p>
Put shortly, exculpatory clauses are okay if they are reasonable. Put not so shortly, exculpatory clauses will generally be held valid if (1) the agreement does not involve a business generally thought suitable for public regulation (a twenty-kilometer bicycle race, for example, is probably not one thought generally suitable for public regulation, whereas a bus line is); (2) the party seeking exculpation is not performing a business of great importance to the public or of practical necessity for some members of the public; (3) the party does not purport to be performing the service to just anybody who comes along (unlike the bus line); (4) the parties are dealing at arms’ length, able to bargain about the contract; (5) the person or property of the purchaser is not placed under control of the seller, subject to his or his agent’s carelessness; or (6) the clause is conspicuous and clear.Henrioulle v. Marin Ventures, Inc., 573 P.2d 465 (Calif. 1978).</p>

<p>
Another broad area in which public policy intrudes on private contractual arrangements is that of undertakings between couples, either prior to or during marriage. Marriage is quintessentially a relationship defined by law, and individuals have limited ability to change its scope through legally enforceable contracts. Moreover, marriage is an institution that public policy favors, and agreements that unreasonably restrain marriage are void. Thus a father’s promise to pay his twenty-one-year-old daughter $100,000 if she refrains from marrying for ten years would be unenforceable. However, a promise in a postnuptial (after marriage) agreement that if the husband predeceases the wife, he will provide his wife with a fixed income for as long as she remains unmarried is valid because the offer of support is related to the need.
</p>

<p>Finally, a promise by an employee not to compete with his or her former employer is scrutinized carefully by the courts, and an injunction<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A judicial order directing a person to stop doing that which he or she should not do.</span>  will be issued cautiously, partly because the prospective employee is usually confronted with a contract of adhesion<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A contract presented to the offeree to take or leave without bargaining.</span> and is in a weak bargaining position compared to the employer, and partly because an injunction might cause the employee’s unemployment. Many courts are not enthusiastic about employment noncompete agreements. The California Business and Professions Code provides that “every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.”<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">California Business and Professions Code, Section 16600.</span>      As a result of the statute, and to promote entrepreneurial robustness, California courts typically interpret the statute broadly and refuse to enforce noncompete agreements. Other states are less stingy, and employers have attempted to avoid the strictures of no-enforcement state rulings by providing that their employment contracts will be interpreted according to the law of a state where noncompetes are favorably viewed.</p>


        <h2>Ways to resolve ambiguity</h2>

<p>
As any reader knows, the meaning of words depends in part on context and in part on the skill and care of the writer. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once succinctly noted, “A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.”<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Towne v. Eisner, 245 US 418, 425 (1917).</span> 
 Words and phrases can be ambiguous, either when they stand alone or when they take on a different coloration from words and phrases near them. A writer can be careless and contradict himself without intending to; people often read hurriedly and easily miss errors that a more deliberate perusal might catch. Interpretation difficulties can arise for any of a number of reasons: a form contract might contain language that is inconsistent with provisions specifically annexed; the parties might use jargon that is unclear; they might forget to incorporate a necessary term; assumptions about prior usage or performance, unknown to outsiders like judges, might color their understanding of the words they do use. Because ambiguities do arise, courts are frequently called on to give content to the words on paper.
</p>

<p>Courts attempt to give meaning to the parties’ understanding when they wrote the contract.
The intention of the parties governs, and if their purpose in making the contract is known or can be ascertained from all the circumstances, it will be given great weight in determining the meaning of an obscure, murky, or ambiguous provision or a pattern of conduct. A father tells the college bookstore that in consideration of its supplying his daughter, a freshman, with books for the coming year, he will guarantee payment of up to $350. His daughter purchases books totaling $400 the first semester, and he pays the bill. Midway through the second semester, the bookstore presents him with a bill for an additional $100, and he pays that. At the end of the year, he refuses to pay a third bill for $150. A court could construe his conduct as indicating a purpose to ensure that his daughter had whatever books she needed, regardless of cost, and interpret the contract to hold him liable for the final bill.</p>
<p>The policy of uncovering purpose has led to a number of tools of judicial interpretation:

<ul>
  <li>More specific terms or conduct are given more weight than general terms or unremarkable conduct. Thus a clause that is separately negotiated and added to a contract will be counted as more significant than a standard term in a form contract.
<li>A writing is interpreted as a whole, without undue attention to one clause.</li>
<li>Common words and terms are given common meaning; technical terms are given their technical meaning.</li>
<li>In the range of language and conduct that helps in interpretation, the courts prefer the following items in the order listed: express terms, course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade.</li>
<li>If an amount is given in words and figures that differ, the words control.</li>
<li>Writing controls over typing; typing controls over printed forms.</li>
<li>Ambiguities are construed against the party that wrote the contract.  </li>

</ul>

    <p class="para editable block" id="e132.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s03_p02">In view of the importance given to the intention of the parties in forming and interpreting contracts, it may seem surprising that the remedy for every breach is not a judicial order that the obligor carry out his undertakings. But it is not. Of course, some duties cannot be performed after a breach: time and circumstances will have altered their purpose and rendered many worthless. Still, although there are numerous occasions on which it would be theoretically possible for courts to order the parties to carry out their contracts, the courts will not do it. In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared in a famous line that “the duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it.” <span class="marginnote"><img src="section_56/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Jr_circa_1930-edit.jpg" height="300px"> <br>Justice Holmes, LOC. </span>


        By that he meant simply that the common law looks more toward compensating the promisee for his loss than toward compelling the promisor to perform—a person always has the power, though not the right, to breach a contract. Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an incentive to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice: to perform or pay. The purpose of contract remedies is, for the most part, to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses suffered—to put the non-breaching party in the position he, she, or it would have been in had there been no breach.

        This is very different than tort law! Tort law looks <em>backward</em>, to put the injured party in the same position as if the tort had not occurred. Contract law looks <em>forward</em> to put the injured party in the same position as if the contract had been fulfilled. These are called "expectation damages." If giving expectation damages is impossible, such as if they cannot be calculated,<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Such as a contract to start a new business, in which nobody knows how well the new business would have performed.</span> the law might <em>then</em> look backward and put the parties in the same position as if the contract had not been entered.s</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="e136.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p01">A basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to compensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the loss as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common law, is <em class="emphasis">Hadley</em> v. <em class="emphasis">Baxendale,</em> decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a flour mill in Gloucester. In May 1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all milling. An employee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as possible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one. The carrier’s agent promised delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than by rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing director of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of Exchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped:</p>

They are not part of the compensation for the loss suffered; they are proper in cases in which the defendant has acted willfully and maliciously and are thought to deter others from acting similarly. Since the purpose of contract law is compensation, not punishment, punitive damages have not traditionally been awarded, with one exception: when the breach of contract is also a tort for which punitive damages may be recovered. Punitive damages are permitted in the law of torts (in most states) when the behavior is malicious or willful (reckless conduct causing physical harm, deliberate defamation of one’s character, a knowingly unlawful taking of someone’s property), and some kinds of contract breach are also tortuous—for example, when a creditor holding collateral as security under a contract for a loan sells the collateral to a good-faith purchaser for value even though the debtor was not in default, he has breached the contract and committed the tort of conversion<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The wrongful taking of someone’s property by another; the civil equivalent of theft.</span></span>.

Many of these cases involve disability payments, and among the elements are charges of tortious conduct by the company’s agents or employees. California has been the leader among the state courts in their growing willingness to uphold punitive damage awards despite insurer complaints that the concept of punitive damages is but a device to permit plaintiffs to extort settlements from hapless companies. Courts have also awarded punitive damages against other types of companies for breach of contract.</p>

Emily signs a contract to sell Charlotte a gold samovar, a Russian antique of great sentimental value because it once belonged to Charlotte’s mother. Emily then repudiates the contract while still executory. A court may properly grant Charlotte an order of specific performance against Emily.

Tom gives Tim $100 to chop his tree into firewood. Tim repudiates. Tom’s restitution interest is $100. But serious difficulties can arise when the benefit conferred was performance. The courts have considerable discretion to award either the cost of hiring someone else to do the work that the injured party performed (generally, the market price of the service) or the value that was added to the property of the party in breach by virtue of the claimant’s performance. Mellors, a gardener, agrees to construct ten fences around Lady Chatterley’s flower gardens at the market price of $2,500. After erecting three, Mellors has performed services that would cost $750, market value. Assume that he has increased the value of the Lady’s grounds by $800. If the contract is repudiated, there are two measures of Mellors’s restitution interest: $800, the value by which the property was enhanced; or $750, the amount it would have cost Lady Chatterley to hire someone else to do the work. Which measure to use depends on who repudiated the contract and for what reason.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="e168.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p03">Buchanan, J.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e169.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p04">This suit was instituted by W. O. Lucy and J. C. Lucy, complainants, against A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer, his wife, defendants, to have specific performance of a contract by which it was alleged the Zehmers had sold to W. O. Lucy a tract of land owned by A. H. Zehmer in Dinwiddie county containing 471.6 acres, more or less, known as the Ferguson farm, for $50,000. J. C. Lucy, the other complainant, is a brother of W. O. Lucy, to whom W. O. Lucy transferred a half interest in his alleged purchase.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e170.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p05">The instrument sought to be enforced was written by A. H. Zehmer on December 20, 1952, in these words: “We hereby agree to sell to W. O. Lucy the Ferguson farm complete for $50,000.00, title satisfactory to buyer,” and signed by the defendants, A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e171.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p06">The answer of A. H. Zehmer admitted that at the time mentioned W. O. Lucy offered him $50,000 cash for the farm, but that he, Zehmer, considered that the offer was made in jest; that so thinking, and both he and Lucy having had several drinks, he wrote out “the memorandum” quoted above and induced his wife to sign it; that he did not deliver the memorandum to Lucy, but that Lucy picked it up, read it, put it in his pocket, attempted to offer Zehmer $5 to bind the bargain, which Zehmer refused to accept, and realizing for the first time that Lucy was serious, Zehmer assured him that he had no intention of selling the farm and that the whole matter was a joke. Lucy left the premises insisting that he had purchased the farm.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e172.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p07">In his testimony Zehmer claimed that he “was high as a Georgia pine,” and that the transaction “was just a bunch of two doggoned drunks bluffing to see who could talk the biggest and say the most.” That claim is inconsistent with his attempt to testify in great detail as to what was said and what was done.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e173.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p08">If it be assumed, contrary to what we think the evidence shows, that Zehmer was jesting about selling his farm to Lucy and that the transaction was intended by him to be a joke, nevertheless the evidence shows that Lucy did not so understand it but considered it to be a serious business transaction and the contract to be binding on the Zehmers as well as on himself. The very next day he arranged with his brother to put up half the money and take a half interest in the land. The day after that he employed an attorney to examine the title. The next night, Tuesday, he was back at Zehmer’s place and there Zehmer told him for the first time, Lucy said, that he wasn’t going to sell and he told Zehmer, “You know you sold that place fair and square.” After receiving the report from his attorney that the title was good he wrote to Zehmer that he was ready to close the deal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e174.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p09">Not only did Lucy actually believe, but the evidence shows he was warranted in believing, that the contract represented a serious business transaction and a good faith sale and purchase of the farm.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e175.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p10">In the field of contracts, as generally elsewhere, “We must look to the outward expression of a person as manifesting his intention rather than to his secret and unexpressed intention.

        <p class="para editable block" id="e176.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p11">At no time prior to the execution of the contract had Zehmer indicated to Lucy by word or act that he was not in earnest about selling the farm. They had argued about it and discussed its terms, as Zehmer admitted, for a long time. Lucy testified that if there was any jesting it was about paying $50,000 that night. The contract and the evidence show that he was not expected to pay the money that night. Zehmer said that after the writing was signed he laid it down on the counter in front of Lucy. Lucy said Zehmer handed it to him. In any event there had been what appeared to be a good faith offer and a good faith acceptance, followed by the execution and apparent delivery of a written contract. Both said that Lucy put the writing in his pocket and then offered Zehmer $5 to seal the bargain. Not until then, even under the defendants’ evidence, was anything said or done to indicate that the matter was a joke. Both of the Zehmers testified that when Zehmer asked his wife to sign he whispered that it was a joke so Lucy wouldn’t hear and that it was not intended that he should hear.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e177.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p12">The mental assent of the parties is not requisite for the formation of a contract. If the words or other acts of one of the parties have but one reasonable meaning, his undisclosed intention is immaterial except when an unreasonable meaning which he attaches to his manifestations is known to the other party.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e178.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p13">“* * * The law, therefore, judges of an agreement between two persons exclusively from those expressions of their intentions which are communicated between them. * * *.” [Citation]</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e179.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p14">An agreement or mutual assent is of course essential to a valid contract but the law imputes to a person an intention corresponding to the reasonable meaning of his words and acts.

        <p class="para editable block" id="e180.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p15">So a person cannot set up that he was merely jesting when his conduct and words would warrant a reasonable person in believing that he intended a real agreement.</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="e188.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p02">432 S.W.2d 647 (Ky. 1968)</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="e189.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p03">R. L. Myre, Sr., Special Commissioner.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e190.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p04">The sole question presented in this case is which of several claimants is entitled to an award for information leading to the apprehension and conviction of certain bank robbers.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e191.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p05">On June 12th or 13th, 1963, three armed men entered the First State Bank, Eubank, Kentucky, and with a display of arms and threats robbed the bank of over $30,000 [about $208,000 in 2010 dollars]. Later in the day they were apprehended by State Policemen Garret Godby, Johnny Simms and Tilford Reppert, placed under arrest, and the entire loot was recovered. Later all of the prisoners were convicted and Garret Godby, Johnny Simms and Tilford Reppert appeared as witnesses at the trial.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e192.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p06">The First State Bank of Eubank was a member of the Kentucky Bankers Association which provided and advertised a reward of $500.00 for the arrest and conviction of each bank robber. Hence the outstanding reward for the three bank robbers was $1,500.00 [about $11,000 in 2010 dollars]. Many became claimants for the reward and the Kentucky State Bankers Association being unable to determine the merits of the claims for the reward asked the circuit court to determine the merits of the various claims and to adjudge who was entitled to receive the reward or share in it. All of the claimants were made defendants in the action.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e193.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p07">At the time of the robbery the claimants Murrell Denney, Joyce Buis, Rebecca McCollum and Jewell Snyder were employees of the First State Bank of Eubank and came out of the grueling situation with great credit and glory. Each one of them deserves approbation and an accolade. They were vigilant in disclosing to the public and the peace officers the details of the crime, and in describing the culprits, and giving all the information that they possessed that would be useful in capturing the robbers. Undoubtedly, they performed a great service. It is in the evidence that the claimant Murrell Denney was conspicuous and energetic in his efforts to make known the robbery, to acquaint the officers as to the personal appearance of the criminals, and to give other pertinent facts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e194.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p08">The first question for determination is whether the employees of the robbed bank are eligible to receive or share in the reward. The great weight of authority answers in the negative. [Citation] states the rule thusly:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e195.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p09">‘To the general rule that, when a reward is offered to the general public for the performance of some specified act, such reward may be claimed by any person who performs such act, is the exception of agents, employees and public officials who are acting within the scope of their employment or official duties. * * *.’…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e196.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p10">At the time of the robbery the claimants Murrell Denney, Joyce Buis, Rebecca McCollum, and Jewell Snyder were employees of the First State Bank of Eubank. They were under duty to protect and conserve the resources and moneys of the bank, and safeguard every interest of the institution furnishing them employment. Each of these employees exhibited great courage, and cool bravery, in a time of stress and danger. The community and the county have recompensed them in commendation, admiration and high praise, and the world looks on them as heroes. But in making known the robbery and assisting in acquainting the public and the officers with details of the crime and with identification of the robbers, they performed a duty to the bank and the public, for which they cannot claim a reward.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e197.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p11">The claims of Corbin Reynolds, Julia Reynolds, Alvie Reynolds and Gene Reynolds also must fail. According to their statements they gave valuable information to the arresting officers. However, they did not follow the procedure as set forth in the offer of reward in that they never filed a claim with the Kentucky Bankers Association. It is well established that a claimant of a reward must comply with the terms and conditions of the offer of reward. [Citation]</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e198.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p12">State Policemen Garret Godby, Johnny Simms and Tilford Reppert made the arrest of the bank robbers and captured the stolen money. All participated in the prosecution. At the time of the arrest, it was the duty of the state policemen to apprehend the criminals. Under the law they cannot claim or share in the reward and they are interposing no claim to it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e199.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p13">This leaves the defendant, Tilford Reppert the sole eligible claimant. The record shows that at the time of the arrest he was a deputy sheriff in Rockcastle County, but the arrest and recovery of the stolen money took place in Pulaski County. He was out of his jurisdiction, and was thus under no legal duty to make the arrest, and is thus eligible to claim and receive the reward. In [Citation] it was said:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e200.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p14">‘It is * * * well established that a public officer with the authority of the law to make an arrest may accept an offer of reward or compensation for acts or services performed outside of his bailiwick or not within the scope of his official duties. * * *.’…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e201.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p15">It is manifest from the record that Tilford Reppert is the only claimant qualified and eligible to receive the reward. Therefore, it is the judgment of the circuit court that he is entitled to receive payment of the $1,500.00 reward now deposited with the Clerk of this Court.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e202.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p16">The judgment is affirmed.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="e210.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p04">The Ransom family owns Rock Bottom Farm in Strafford, Vermont, where Earl Ransom owns a dairy herd and operates an organic dairy farm. In 2000, the Ransoms decided to build a creamery on-site to process their milk and formed EBWS, LLC to operate the dairy-processing plant and to market the plant’s products. In July 2000, Earl Ransom, on behalf of EBWS, met with Britly’s president to discuss building the creamery.…In January 2001, EBWS and Britly entered into a contract requiring Britly to construct a creamery building for EBWS in exchange for $160,318.…The creamery was substantially completed by April 15, 2001, and EBWS moved in soon afterward. On June 5, 2001, EBWS notified Britly of alleged defects in construction. [EBWS continued to use the creamery pending the necessity to vacate it for three weeks when repairs were commenced].</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e211.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p05">On September 12, 2001, EBWS filed suit against Britly for damages resulting from defective design and construction.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e212.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p06">Following a three-day trial, the jury found Britly had breached the contract and its express warranty, and awarded EBWS: (1) $38,020 in direct damages, and (2) $35,711 in consequential damages.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e213.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p07">…The jury’s award to EBWS included compensation for both direct and consequential damages that EBWS claimed it would incur while the facility closed for repairs. Direct damages [i.e., compensatory damages] are for “losses that naturally and usually flow from the breach itself,” and it is not necessary that the parties actually considered these damages. [Citation]. In comparison, special or consequential damages “must pass the tests of causation, certainty and foreseeability, and, in addition, be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e214.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p08">…The court ruled that EBWS could not recover for lost profits because it was not a going concern at the time the contract was entered into, and profits were too speculative. The court concluded, however, that EBWS could submit evidence of other business losses, including future payment for unused milk and staff wages.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e215.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p09">At trial, Huyffer, the CEO of EBWS, testified that during a repairs closure the creamery would be required to purchase milk from adjacent Rock Bottom Farm, even though it could not process this milk. She admitted that such a requirement was self-imposed as there was no written output contract between EBWS and the farm to buy milk. In addition, Huyffer testified that EBWS would pay its employees during the closure even though EBWS has no written contract to pay its employees when they are not working. The trial court allowed these elements of damages to be submitted to the jury, and the jury awarded EBWS consequential damages for unused milk and staff wages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e216.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p10">On appeal, Britly contends that because there is no contractual or legal obligation for EBWS to purchase milk or pay its employees, these are not foreseeable damages. EBWS counters that it is common knowledge that cows continue to produce milk, even if the processing plant is not working, and thus it is foreseeable that this loss would occur. We conclude that these damages are not the foreseeable result of Britly’s breach of the construction contract and reverse the award.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e217.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p11">[W]e conclude that…it is not reasonable to expect Britly to foresee that its failure to perform under the contract would result in this type of damages. While we are sympathetic to EBWS’s contention that the cows continue to produce milk, even when the plant is closed down, this fact alone is not enough to demonstrate that buying and dumping milk is a foreseeable result of Britly’s breach of the construction contract. Here, the milk was produced by a separate and distinct entity, Rock Bottom Farm, which sold the milk to EBWS.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e218.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p12">Similarly, EBWS maintained no employment agreements with its employees obligating it to pay wages during periods of closure for repairs, dips in market demand, or for any other reason. Any losses EBWS might suffer in the future because it chooses to pay its employees during a plant closure for repairs would be a voluntary expense and not in Britly’s contemplation at the time it entered the construction contract. It is not reasonable to expect Britly to foresee losses incurred as a result of agreements that are informal in nature and carry no legal obligation on EBWS to perform. “[P]arties are not presumed to know the condition of each other’s affairs nor to take into account contracts with a third party that is not communicated.” [Citation] While it is true that EBWS may have business reasons to pay its employees even without a contractual obligation, for example, to ensure employee loyalty, no evidence was introduced at trial by EBWS to support a sound rationale for such considerations. Under these circumstances, this business decision is beyond the scope of what Britly could have reasonably foreseen as damages for its breach of contract.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e219.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p13">In addition, the actual costs of the wages and milk are uncertain.…[T]he the milk and wages here are future expenses, for which no legal obligation was assumed by EBWS, and which are separate from the terms of the parties’ contract. We note that at the time of the construction contract EBWS had not yet begun to operate as a creamery and had no history of buying milk or paying employees. See [Citation] (explaining that profits for a new business are uncertain and speculative and not recoverable). Thus, both the cost of the milk and the number and amount of wages of future employees that EBWS might pay in the event of a plant closure for repairs are uncertain.</p>

    <div class="callout editable block" id="e224.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s05_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="e225.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s05_p01">In this chapter we have seen that two fundamental sources of contract law are the common law as developed in the state courts and as summarized in the <em class="emphasis">Restatement (Second) of Contracts,</em> and the Uniform Commercial Code for the sale of goods.</p>
        <p class="para" id="e226.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s05_p02">Sales law is a special type of contract law, governed by Article 2 of the UCC. Article 2 governs the sale of goods only, defined as things movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale. When the goods are “sold” incidental to a service, the courts do not agree on whether Article 2 applies. For two categories of goods, legislation specifically answers the question: foodstuffs served by a restaurant are goods; blood supplied for transfusions is not.</p>
        <p class="para" id="e227.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s05_p03">Types of contracts can be distinguished along these axes: (1) express and implied, including quasi-contracts implied by law; (2) bilateral and unilateral; (3) enforceable and unenforceable; and (4) completed (executed) and uncompleted (executory). To understand contract law, it is necessary to master these distinctions and their nuances.</p>
        <p class="para" id="e228.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s05_p04">In order to determine whether a valid, enforceable contract exists, the following questions must be answered: (1) Did the parties reach an agreement? (2) Was consideration present? (3) Was the agreement legal? (4) Did the parties have capacity to make a contract? (5) Was the agreement in the proper form?</p>
        <p>If a contract is formed, the law provides additional ways to ensure that a true "meeting of the minds" occurred. Doctrines such as fraud, duress, mistake and undue influence provide remedies. The law also provides ways to avoid contracts against public policy, such as overly broad exculpatory contracts or contracts so unfair they shock the conscience of the court.</p>
        <p class="para" id="e229.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_s05_p05">Remedies available against someone who breaches a contract include damages, specific performance, and restitution. Frequently the party who is not in breach must choose between tort and contract remedies.</p>

            <li>On a busy day just before April 15, Albert Accountant received a call from a local car dealer. The dealer said, “Hi, Mr. Accountant. Now, while you have income from doing clients’ taxes, I have an excellent offer for you. You can buy a new Buick Century automobile completely loaded for $36,000. Al, I know you’re busy. If I don’t hear from you by the end of the day, I’ll assume you want the car.” Albert, distracted, did not respond immediately, and the dealer hung up. Then followed an exhausting day of working with anxiety-ridden tax clients. Albert forgot about the conversation. Two days later a statement arrived from the dealer, with instructions on how Albert should pick up the car at the dealership. Is there a contract? Explain.</li>
            <li>Bert purchased Ernie’s car. Before selling the car, Ernie had stated to Bert, “This car runs well and is reliable. Last week I drove the car all the way from Seattle to San Francisco to visit my mother and back again to Seattle.” In fact, Ernie was not telling the truth: he had driven the car to San Francisco to visit his paramour, not his mother. Upon discovery of the truth, may Bert avoid the contract? Why?</li>

            <li>Sara Hohe, a fifteen-year-old junior at Mission Bay High School in San Diego, was injured during a campus hypnotism show sponsored by the PTSA as a fund-raiser for the senior class. Hypnotism shows had been held annually since 1980, and Sara had seen the previous year’s show. She was selected at random from a group of many volunteers. Her participation in the “Magic of the Mind Show” was conditioned on signing two release forms. Hohe’s father signed a form entitled “Mission Bay High School PTSA Presents Dr. Karl Santo.” Hohe and her father both signed a form titled “Karl Santo Hypnotist,” releasing Santo and the school district from all liability. During the course of the show, while apparently hypnotized, Hohe slid from her chair and also fell to the floor about six times and was injured. She, through her father, then sued the school district. The Hohes claimed the release was contrary to public policy; the trial court dismissed the suit on summary judgment. Was the release contrary to public policy? Decide.</li>
            <li>Plaintiff Irma Kozlowski cohabited with Defendant Thaddeus Kozlowski for fifteen years without marriage. She repeatedly asked him specifically about her financial situation should he predecease her, and he assured her—she said—that he would arrange to provide for her for the rest of her life. She had provided the necessary household services and emotional support to permit him to successfully pursue his business career; she had performed housekeeping, cleaning, and shopping services and had run the household and raised the children, her own as well as his. When they separated and she was “literally forced out of the house,” she was sixty-three years old and had no means or wherewithal for survival. When she sued, he raised the Statute of Frauds’ one-year rule as a defense. Is the defense good?</li>
            <li>Owner of an auto repair shop hires Contractor to remodel his shop but does not mention that two days after the scheduled completion date, Owner is to receive five small US Army personnel carrier trucks for service, with a three-week deadline to finish the job and turn the trucks over to the army. The contract between Owner and the army has a liquidated damages clause calling for $300 a day for every day trucks are not operable after the deadline. Contractor is five days late in finishing the remodel. Can Owner claim the $1,500 as damages against Contractor as a consequence of the latter’s tardy completion of the contract? Explain.</li>
