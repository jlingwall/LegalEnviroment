## The Illiad {data-background=skyline.jpg data-background-size=cover}

But Achilles hath wrought to fury the proud heart within him, cruel man! neither recketh he of the love of his comrades wherewith we ever honoured him amid the ships above all others—pitiless one! Lo, a man accepteth recompense from the slayer of his brother, or for his dead son; and the slayer abideth in his own land for the paying of a great price, and the kinsman's heart and proud spirit are restrained by the taking of recompense.

<!-- In this class exercise we try to come up with universal rules: what should the law do in each case? Generally, there's always room to push back on the proposed rules. -->

# If the notion of tort law is ancient, can we intuit it?

## Roadmap {data-background=roadmap.jpg data-background-size=cover}

- What _are_ torts?
- Intentional torts
	+ E.g., assault and battery
- Negligence
	+ Unintentional carelessness which results in harm
- Strict liability
	+ Briefly, as we will cover during product liability


## What is a tort? {data-background=skyline.jpg data-background-size=cover}

A tort is a legally-actionable wrong. If you or your property has been injured by another, tort law is likely your remedy.

## What’s the point? First, make you whole {data-background=skyline.jpg data-background-size=cover}

- Put you in the same position as if there had been no tort
- Compensatory damages
	+ Special damages = we can put a price tag on it
		+ Medical expenses, lost wages
	+ General damages = harder to put a price tag on
		+ Pain and suffering
		+ Loss of companionship
		+ Disfigurement

## What’s the point? At times, punish {data-background=skyline.jpg data-background-size=cover}
- Punitive damages
	+ Punish the wrongdoer
	+ Generally only available for intentional torts and gross negligence, with a higher degree of culpability
	+ Due process limitations ....
