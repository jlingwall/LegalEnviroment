## Ethics is not the law

- Slavery, for years
- Slack fill
- Contracts versus promises
- Adverse employment actions not based on Title VII

Why then do we study it?


# In the spirit of "natural law", can we build a consistent theory of ethics from scratch?

## Universally "bad" behavior? {data-background=mark-rabe-zCJrolkwRyE-unsplash.jpg data-background-size=cover}
Remember IRAC: do we need a definition of "bad" first?


## Universally "good" behavior? {data-background=mark-rabe-zCJrolkwRyE-unsplash.jpg data-background-size=cover}
Definition of good, first?

## Can we assign these points? {data-background=mark-rabe-zCJrolkwRyE-unsplash.jpg data-background-size=cover}

# This is _utilitarianism_

# As a utilitarian, I should give everyone in this class an A. To not would be unethical.


## <span style="color:white"> Utilitarianism in a nutshell </span> {data-background=wouter-salari-6eZgtpXdlDk-unsplash.jpg data-background-size=cover}
<span style="color:white">
<ul>
<li> Act in a way that delivers the greatest good for society</li>
<li> But good for whom?</li>
<li> And can we measure it?</li>
<li> And over what time horizon?</li>
<li> And what if there is value in suffering?</li>
<li> And can we  live with the paralyzing consequences?</li>
</ul>

## Would it be easier to just follow a set of rules?
- This is _deontology_
- We may follow rules from religion, or principles of rights, or philosophy
    - E.g., Kant's "categorical imperative"

- We may follow rules from religion, or principles of rights, or philosophy
    - E.g., Kant's "categorical imperative"
- But this has it's own set of of problems:
    - What if the rules are bad?
    - What if they don't cover a situation?
    - What if the rules lead to strange results?
        - E.g., is choosing not have children unethical by the categorical imperative?

    - Which virtues?
    - What if they conflict? E.g., liberty and equality?

# How does <br /> this  apply <br /> to companies? {data-background=sean-pollock-PhYq704ffdA-unsplash.jpg data-background-size=cover}

## Stakeholder analysis
- Identify the stakeholders: potential gainers and losers
- For a corporation, we need to consider

## Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) says companies should consider the needs of all stakeholders (employees, community, customers, environment, etc), rather than just attempting to maximize shareholder profit

- Can corporations legally do this?
- Is it in their long-term, strategic interest?
- What about <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/about/mission-impact">"benefit corporations"</a>?
- Or <a href="https://bcorporation.net/">"certified B-Corps"</a>?

## Practice
> - On a sheet of paper, list your favorite brand
> - What do you know about their CSR practices?
> - What can you find out in five minutes?
> - Does this make you more likely to buy from this company?
