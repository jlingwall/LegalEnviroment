## Sources (and priority) of law {data-background=mark-rabe-zCJrolkwRyE-unsplash.jpg data-background-size=cover}

<div class="notes">
- Constitutions (as interpreted by Supreme Courts)
- Statutes
- Regulations (also called "rules", just to be confusing)
- Court decisions
  - _Note: These also give you the list to workdown to find legal rules. First, does a constitution speak to the question? Next, does a statute? And so on._
