        <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_p01">After reading this chapter, you should understand the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_l01">
            <li>Contracts require “a meeting of the minds” between competent parties, and if there is no such “meeting,” the agreement is usually voidable.</li>
            <li>Parties must enter the contract voluntarily, without duress or undue influence.</li>
            <li>Misrepresentation or fraud, when proven, vitiates a contract.</li>
            <li>A mistake may make a contract voidable.</li>
            <li>Parties to a contract must have capacity—that is, not labor under infancy, intoxication, or insanity.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_p02">We turn to the second of the four requirements for a valid contract. In addition to manifestation of assent, a party’s assent must be real; he or she must consent to the contract freely, with adequate knowledge, and must have capacity. The requirement of real assent raises the following major questions:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_l02">
        <li>Did the parties enter into the contract of their own free will, or was one forced to agree under duress or undue influence?</li>
        <li>Did the parties enter into the contract with full knowledge of the facts, or was one or both led to the agreement through fraud or mistake?</li>
        <li>Did both parties have the capacity to make a contract?</li>
    </ol>
