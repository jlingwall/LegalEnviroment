            <li>How an assignment of contract rights is made and how it operates</li>
            <li>What a delegation of duties is and how it operates</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch14_p02">To this point, we have focused on the rights and duties of the two parties to the contract.

    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch14_l02">
        <li>Assignees (outsiders who acquire rights after the contract is made)</li>
        <li>Delegatees (outsiders who acquire duties after the contract is made)</li>
        <li>Third-party beneficiaries (outsiders who acquire rights when the original contract is made)</li>
    </ol>
