    <p class="para editable block" id="e5.mayermaster_1.0-ch08_p02">The two legal cornerstones of business relationships are contract and tort. Although both involve the concept of duty, creation of the duty differs in a manner that is important to business. The parties create <em class="emphasis">contract</em> duties through a bargaining process. The key element in the process is voluntary consent; individuals are in control of a situation because they have the freedom to decide whether to enter into a contractual relationship. <em class="emphasis">Tort</em> duties, in contrast, are obligations the law imposes, whether or not the parties like it. Despite the obvious difficulty in controlling tort liability, an understanding of tort theory is important because it is a critical factor in strategic planning and risk management.</p>

<p>This chapter offers a condensed version of Chapters 8 through 19. If you wish to explore an area in greater detail, many of these issues are treated much more extensively in those chapters.</p>
