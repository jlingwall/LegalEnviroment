<p>Because contracts are voluntary agreements the law will enforce, the common law developed a variety of doctrines that responded to situations in which someone was not truly free to enter into the contract, or to situations in which courts felt it unfair to enforce the agreement. In this section we will study these doctrines.</p>
        

        <h2>Fraud</h2>

<p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p02">Misrepresentation<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A false or misleading statement or impression given that induces a party to contract.</span></span> is a statement of fact that is not consistent with the truth. If misrepresentation is intentional, it is fraudulent misrepresentation; if it is not intentional, it is nonfraudulent misrepresentation, which can be either negligent or innocent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p03">In further taxonomy, courts distinguish between fraud in the execution and fraud in the inducement. Fraud in the execution<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Causing a person to sign a legal document while that person believes he or she is signing some other type of document.</span></span> is defined by the Restatement as follows: “If a misrepresentation as to the character or essential terms of a proposed contract induces conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by one who neither knows nor has reasonable opportunity to know of the character or essential terms of the proposed contract, his conduct is not effective as a manifestation of assent.”<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 163.</span> For example, Alphonse and Gaston decide to sign a written contract incorporating terms to which they have agreed. It is properly drawn up, and Gaston reads it and approves it. Before he can sign it, however, Alphonse shrewdly substitutes a different version to which Gaston has not agreed. Gaston signs the substitute version. There is no contract. There has been fraud in the execution.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p04">Fraud in the inducement<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Deceit or trick to cause someone to contract to his or her disadvantage.</span></span> is more common. It involves some misrepresentation about the subject of the contract that induces assent. Alphonse tells Gaston that the car Gaston is buying from Alphonse has just been overhauled—which pleases Gaston—but it has not been. This renders the contract voidable.</p>

            <h3 class="title editable block">Misstatement of Fact</h3>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_p01">Again, generally, any statement not in accord with the facts (a fact is something amenable to testing as true) is a misrepresentation. Falsity does not depend on intent. A typist’s unnoticed error in a letter (inadvertently omitting the word “not,” for example, or transposing numbers) can amount to a misrepresentation on which the recipient may rely (it is not fraudulent misrepresentation). A half-truth can amount to a misrepresentation, as, for example, when the seller of a hotel says that the income is from both permanent and transient guests but fails to disclose that the bulk of the income is from single-night stopovers by seamen using the hotel as a brothel. <label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em class="emphasis">Ikeda v.

                <h3 class="title editable block">Concealment</h3>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">Another type of misrepresentation is concealment. It is an act that is equivalent to a statement that the facts are to the contrary and that serves to prevent the other party from learning the true statement of affairs; it is hiding the truth. A common example is painting over defects in a building—by concealing the defects, the owner is misrepresenting the condition of the property. The act of concealment need not be direct; it may consist of sidetracking the other party from gaining necessary knowledge by, for example, convincing a third person who has knowledge of the defect not to speak. Concealment is always a misrepresentation.</p>

                <h3 class="title editable block">Nondisclosure</h3>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s02_p01">A more passive type of concealment is nondisclosure. Although generally the law imposes no obligation on anyone to speak out, nondisclosure of a fact can operate as a misrepresentation under certain circumstances. This occurs, for example, whenever the other party has erroneous information, or, as <em class="emphasis">Reed v. King</em> (<a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch10_s05#mayer_1.0-ch10_s05_s02">Section 10.5.2 "Misrepresentation by Concealment"</a>) shows, where the nondisclosure amounts to a failure to act in good faith, or where the party who conceals knows or should know that the other side cannot, with reasonable diligence, discover the truth.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s02_p02">In a remarkable 1991 case out of New York, a New York City stockbroker bought an old house upstate (basically anyplace north of New York City) in the village of Nyack, north of New York City, and then wanted out of the deal when he discovered—the defendant seller had not told him—that it was “haunted.” The court summarized the facts: “Plaintiff, to his horror, discovered that the house he had recently contracted to purchase was widely reputed to be possessed by poltergeists [ghosts], reportedly seen by defendant seller and members of her family on numerous occasions over the last nine years. Plaintiff promptly commenced this action seeking rescission of the contract of sale. Supreme Court reluctantly dismissed the complaint, holding that plaintiff has no remedy at law in this jurisdiction.”</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s02_p03">The high court of New York ruled he could rescind the contract because the house was “haunted as a matter of law”: the defendant had promoted it as such on village tours and in <em class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest</em>. She had concealed it, and no reasonable buyer’s inspection would have revealed the “fact.” The dissent basically hooted, saying, “The existence of a poltergeist is no more binding upon the defendants than it is upon this court.” <label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em class="emphasis">Stambovsky v.

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s03_p01">If a statement of fact is made false by later events, it must be disclosed as false. For example, in idle chatter one day, Alphonse tells Gaston that he owns thirty acres of land. In fact, Alphonse owns only twenty-seven, but he decided to exaggerate a little. He meant no harm by it, since the conversation had no import. A year later, Gaston offers to buy the “thirty acres” from Alphonse, who does not correct the impression that Gaston has. The failure to speak is a nondisclosure—presumably intentional, in this situation—that would allow Gaston to rescind a contract induced by his belief that he was purchasing thirty acres.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s04_p01">An opinion, of course, is not a fact; neither is sales puffery. For example, the statements “In my opinion this apple is very tasty” and “These apples are the best in the county” are not facts; they are not expected to be taken as true. Reliance on opinion is hazardous and generally not considered justifiable.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s04_p02">If Jack asks what condition the car is in that he wishes to buy, Mr. Olson’s response of “Great!” is not ordinarily a misrepresentation. As the Restatement puts it: “The propensity of sellers and buyers to exaggerate the advantages to the other party of the bargains they promise is well recognized, and to some extent their assertions must be discounted.”<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 168(d).</span>
 Vague statements of quality, such as that a product is “good,” ought to suggest nothing other than that such is the personal judgment of the opinion holder.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s01_s04_p03">Despite this general rule, there are certain exceptions that justify reliance on opinions and effectively make them into facts. Merely because someone is less astute than the one with whom she is bargaining does not give rise to a claim of justifiable reliance on an unwarranted opinion. But if the person is inexperienced and susceptible or gullible to blandishments, the contract can be voided, as illustrated in <em class="emphasis">Vokes v. Arthur Murray, Inc.</em> in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch10_s05#mayer_1.0-ch10_s05_s03">Section 10.5.3 "Misrepresentation by Assertions of Opinion"</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Intentionally Made Misrepresentation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s02_p01">The second element necessary to prove fraud is that the misrepresentation was intentionally made. A misrepresentation is intentionally made “if the maker intends his assertion to induce a party to manifest his assent and the maker (a) knows or believes that the assertion is not in accord with the facts, or (b) does not have the confidence that he states or implies in the truth of the assertion, or (c) knows that he does not have the basis that he states or implies for the assertion.”<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 162(1).</span> </p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s02_p02">The question of intent often has practical consequences in terms of the remedy available to the plaintiff. If the misrepresentation is fraudulent, the plaintiff may, as an alternative to avoiding the contract, recover damages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reliance</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s03_p01">The final element necessary to prove fraud is reliance by the victim. He or she must show that the misrepresentation induced assent—that is, he or she relied on it. The reliance need not be solely on the false assertion; the defendant cannot win the case by demonstrating that the plaintiff would have assented to the contract even without the misrepresentation. It is sufficient to avoid the contract if the plaintiff weighed the assertion as one of the important factors leading him to make the contract, and he believed it to be true. The person who asserts reliance to avoid a contract must have acted in good faith and reasonably in relying on the false assertion. Thus if the victim failed to read documents given him that truly stated the facts, he cannot later complain that he relied on a contrary statement, as, for example, when the purchaser of a car dealership was told the inventory consisted of new cars, but the supporting papers, receipt of which he acknowledged, clearly stated how many miles each car had been driven. If Mr. Olson tells Jack that the car Jack is interested in is “a recognized classic,” and if Jack doesn’t care a whit about that but buys the car because he likes its tail fins, he will have no case against Mr. Olson when he finds out the car is not a classic: it didn’t matter to him, and he didn’t rely on it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_s03_p02">Ordinarily, the person relying on a statement need not verify it independently. However, if verification is relatively easy, or if the statement is one that concerns matters peculiarly within the person’s purview, he or she may not be held to have justifiably relied on the other party’s false assertion. Moreover, usually the rule of reliance applies to statements about past events or existing facts, not about the occurrence of events in the future.</p>

        <h2>Mistake</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s03_p01">In discussing fraud, we have considered the ways in which trickery by the other party makes a contract void or voidable. We now examine the ways in which the parties might “trick” themselves by making assumptions that lead them mistakenly to believe that they have agreed to something they have not. A mistake is “a belief about a fact that is not in accord with the truth.”

    Just before the plaintiff was to take Rose from the defendant’s barn, the defendant discovered she was “large with calf”; he refused to go on with the contract. The court held this was a mutual mistake of fact—“a barren cow is substantially a different creature than a breeding one”—and ruled for the defendant. That she was infertile was “a basic assumption,” but—for example—that hay would be readily available to feed her inexpensively was not, and had hay been expensive, that would not have vitiated the contract.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p02">Comment (a) to Section 174 provides in part, “This Section involves an application of that principle to those <em class="emphasis">relatively rare situations in which actual physical force</em> has been used to compel a party to appear to assent to a contract.…The essence of this type of duress is that a party is compelled by physical force to do an act that he has no intention of doing. He is, it is sometimes said, ‘a mere mechanical instrument.’ The result is that there is no contract at all, or a ‘void contract’ as distinguished from a voidable one” (emphasis added).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p02">First, the threat must be improper. Second, there must be no reasonable alternative. If, for example, a supplier threatens to hold up shipment of necessary goods unless the buyer agrees to pay more than the contract price, this would not be duress if the buyer could purchase identical supplies from someone else. Third, the test for inducement is subjective. It does not matter that the person threatened is unusually timid or that a reasonable person would not have felt threatened. The question is whether the threat in fact induced assent by the victim. Such facts as the victim’s belief that the threatener had the ability to carry out the threat and the length of time between the threat and assent are relevant in determining whether the threat did prompt the assent.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p03">There are many types of improper threats that might induce a party to enter into a contract: threats to commit a crime or a tort (e.g., bodily harm or taking of property), to instigate criminal prosecution, to instigate civil proceedings when a threat is made in bad faith, to breach a “duty of good faith and fair dealing under a contract with the recipient,” or to disclose embarrassing details about a person’s private life.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p04">Jack buys a car from a local used-car salesman, Mr. Olson, and the next day realizes he bought a lemon. He threatens to break windows in Olson’s showroom if Olson does not buy the car back for $2,150, the purchase price. Mr. Olson agrees. The agreement is voidable, even though the underlying deal is fair, if Olson feels he has no reasonable alternative and is frightened into agreeing. Suppose Jack knows that Olson has been tampering with his cars’ odometers, a federal offense, and threatens to have Olson prosecuted if he will not repurchase the car. Even though Olson may be guilty, this threat makes the repurchase contract voidable, because it is a misuse for personal ends of a power (to go to the police) given each of us for other purposes. If these threats failed, suppose Jack then tells Olson, “I’m going to haul you into court and sue your pants off.” If Jack means he will sue for his purchase price, this is not an improper threat, because everyone has the right to use the courts to gain what they think is rightfully theirs. But if Jack meant that he would fabricate damages done him by a (falsely) claimed odometer manipulation, that would be an improper threat. Although Olson could defend against the suit, his reputation would suffer in the meantime from his being accused of odometer tampering.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p05">A threat to breach a contract that induces the victim to sign a new contract could be improper. Suppose that as part of the original purchase price, Olson agrees to make all necessary repairs and replace all failed parts for the first ninety days. At the end of one month, the transmission dies, and Jack demands a replacement. Olson refuses to repair the car unless Jack signs a contract agreeing to buy his next car from Olson. Whether this threat is improper depends on whether Jack has a reasonable alternative; if a replacement transmission is readily available and Jack has the funds to pay for it, he might have an alternative in suing Olson in small claims court for the cost. But if Jack needs the car immediately and he is impecunious, then the threat would be improper and the contract voidable. A threat to breach a contract is not necessarily improper, however. It depends on whether the new contract is fair and equitable because of unanticipated circumstances. If, for example, Olson discovers that he must purchase a replacement transmission at three times the anticipated cost, his threat to hold up work unless Jack agrees to pay for it might be reasonable.</p>

It is a milder form of duress than physical harm or threats. The unfairness does not lie in any misrepresentation; rather, it occurs when the victim is under the domination of the persuader or is one who, in view of the relationship between them, is warranted in believing that the persuader will act in a manner detrimental to the victim’s welfare if the victim fails to assent. It is the improper use of trust or power to deprive a person of free will and substitute instead another’s objective. Usually the fact pattern involves the victim being isolated from receiving advice except from the persuader. Falling within this rule are situations where, for example, a child takes advantage of an infirm parent, a doctor takes advantage of an ill patient, or a lawyer takes advantage of an unknowledgeable client. If there has been undue influence, the contract is voidable by the party who has been unfairly persuaded. Whether the relationship is one of domination and the persuasion is unfair is a factual question. The answer hinges on a host of variables, including “the unfairness of the resulting bargain, the unavailability of independent advice, and the susceptibility of the person persuaded.” <label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 177(b).</span> See <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch10_s05#mayer_1.0-ch10_s05_s01">Section 10.5.1 "Undue Influence"</a>, <em class="emphasis">Hodge v.

        <h2>Illegal contracts</h2>

                <h3>Contracts that violate a statute</h3>

<p>
Any bargain that violates the criminal law—including statutes that govern extortion, robbery, embezzlement, forgery, some gambling, licensing, and consumer credit transactions—is illegal. Thus determining whether contracts are lawful may seem to be an easy enough task. Clearly, whenever the statute itself explicitly forbids the making of the contract or the performance agreed upon, the bargain (such as a contract to sell drugs) is unlawful. But when the statute does not expressly prohibit the making of the contract, courts examine a number of factors.</p>


        <h3>Unconscionable contracts</h3>


 <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p01">Courts may refuse to enforce unconscionable contracts<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A contract so unfair as to be unenforceable.</span></span>, those that are very one-sided, unfair, the product of unequal bargaining power, or oppressive; a court may find the contract divisible and enforce only the parts that are not unconscionable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p02">The common-law rule is reflected in Section 208 of the Restatement: “If a contract or term thereof is unconscionable at the time the contract is made a court may refuse to enforce the contract, or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable term, or may so limit the application of any unconscionable term as to avoid any unconscionable result.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p03">And the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) (again, of course, a statute, not common law) provides a similar rule in Section 2-302(1): “If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p04"><em class="emphasis">Unconscionable</em> is not defined in the Restatement or the UCC, but cases have given gloss to the meaning, as in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch12_s05#mayer_1.0-ch12_s05_s03">Section 12.5.3 "Unconscionability"</a>, <em class="emphasis">Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.</em>, a well-known early interpretation of the section by the DC Court of Appeals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p05">Unconscionability may arise procedurally or substantively. A term is procedurally unconscionable if it is imposed upon the “weaker” party because of fine or inconspicuous print, unexpected placement in the contract, lack of opportunity to read the term, lack of education or sophistication that precludes understanding, or lack of equality of bargaining power. Substantive unconscionability arises where the affected terms are oppressive and harsh, where the term deprives a party of any real remedy for breach. Most often—but not always—courts find unconscionable contracts in the context of consumer transactions rather than commercial transactions. In the latter case, the assumption is that the parties tend to be sophisticated businesspeople able to look out for their own contract interests.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Specific contractual pitfalls</h3>

<p>Courts have long held that public policy disfavors attempts to contract out of tort liability. Exculpatory clauses that exempt one party from tort liability to the other for harm caused intentionally or recklessly are unenforceable without exception. A contract provision that exempts a party from tort liability for negligence is unenforceable under two general circumstances: (1) when it “exempts an employer from liability to an employee for injury in the course of his employment” or (2) when it exempts one charged with a duty of public service and who is receiving compensation from liability to one to whom the duty is owed.<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 195.</span>   Contract terms with offensive exculpatory clauses may be considered somewhat akin to unconscionability.
</p>
<p>
Put shortly, exculpatory clauses are okay if they are reasonable. Put not so shortly, exculpatory clauses will generally be held valid if (1) the agreement does not involve a business generally thought suitable for public regulation (a twenty-kilometer bicycle race, for example, is probably not one thought generally suitable for public regulation, whereas a bus line is); (2) the party seeking exculpation is not performing a business of great importance to the public or of practical necessity for some members of the public; (3) the party does not purport to be performing the service to just anybody who comes along (unlike the bus line); (4) the parties are dealing at arms’ length, able to bargain about the contract; (5) the person or property of the purchaser is not placed under control of the seller, subject to his or his agent’s carelessness; or (6) the clause is conspicuous and clear.Henrioulle v. Marin Ventures, Inc., 573 P.2d 465 (Calif. 1978).</p>

<p>
Another broad area in which public policy intrudes on private contractual arrangements is that of undertakings between couples, either prior to or during marriage. Marriage is quintessentially a relationship defined by law, and individuals have limited ability to change its scope through legally enforceable contracts. Moreover, marriage is an institution that public policy favors, and agreements that unreasonably restrain marriage are void. Thus a father’s promise to pay his twenty-one-year-old daughter $100,000 if she refrains from marrying for ten years would be unenforceable. However, a promise in a postnuptial (after marriage) agreement that if the husband predeceases the wife, he will provide his wife with a fixed income for as long as she remains unmarried is valid because the offer of support is related to the need.
</p>

<p>Finally, a promise by an employee not to compete with his or her former employer is scrutinized carefully by the courts, and an injunction<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A judicial order directing a person to stop doing that which he or she should not do.</span>  will be issued cautiously, partly because the prospective employee is usually confronted with a contract of adhesion<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A contract presented to the offeree to take or leave without bargaining.</span> and is in a weak bargaining position compared to the employer, and partly because an injunction might cause the employee’s unemployment. Many courts are not enthusiastic about employment noncompete agreements. The California Business and Professions Code provides that “every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.”<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">California Business and Professions Code, Section 16600.</span>      As a result of the statute, and to promote entrepreneurial robustness, California courts typically interpret the statute broadly and refuse to enforce noncompete agreements. Other states are less stingy, and employers have attempted to avoid the strictures of no-enforcement state rulings by providing that their employment contracts will be interpreted according to the law of a state where noncompetes are favorably viewed.</p>


        <h2>Ways to resolve ambiguity</h2>

<p>
As any reader knows, the meaning of words depends in part on context and in part on the skill and care of the writer. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once succinctly noted, “A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.”<label for="thisid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thisid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Towne v. Eisner, 245 US 418, 425 (1917).</span> 
 Words and phrases can be ambiguous, either when they stand alone or when they take on a different coloration from words and phrases near them. A writer can be careless and contradict himself without intending to; people often read hurriedly and easily miss errors that a more deliberate perusal might catch. Interpretation difficulties can arise for any of a number of reasons: a form contract might contain language that is inconsistent with provisions specifically annexed; the parties might use jargon that is unclear; they might forget to incorporate a necessary term; assumptions about prior usage or performance, unknown to outsiders like judges, might color their understanding of the words they do use. Because ambiguities do arise, courts are frequently called on to give content to the words on paper.
</p>

<p>Courts attempt to give meaning to the parties’ understanding when they wrote the contract.
The intention of the parties governs, and if their purpose in making the contract is known or can be ascertained from all the circumstances, it will be given great weight in determining the meaning of an obscure, murky, or ambiguous provision or a pattern of conduct. A father tells the college bookstore that in consideration of its supplying his daughter, a freshman, with books for the coming year, he will guarantee payment of up to $350. His daughter purchases books totaling $400 the first semester, and he pays the bill. Midway through the second semester, the bookstore presents him with a bill for an additional $100, and he pays that. At the end of the year, he refuses to pay a third bill for $150. A court could construe his conduct as indicating a purpose to ensure that his daughter had whatever books she needed, regardless of cost, and interpret the contract to hold him liable for the final bill.</p>
<p>The policy of uncovering purpose has led to a number of tools of judicial interpretation:

<ul>
  <li>More specific terms or conduct are given more weight than general terms or unremarkable conduct. Thus a clause that is separately negotiated and added to a contract will be counted as more significant than a standard term in a form contract.
<li>A writing is interpreted as a whole, without undue attention to one clause.</li>
<li>Common words and terms are given common meaning; technical terms are given their technical meaning.</li>
<li>In the range of language and conduct that helps in interpretation, the courts prefer the following items in the order listed: express terms, course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade.</li>
<li>If an amount is given in words and figures that differ, the words control.</li>
<li>Writing controls over typing; typing controls over printed forms.</li>
<li>Ambiguities are construed against the party that wrote the contract.  </li>

</ul>
